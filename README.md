# Discord RPC

Because the library I use for RPC actually uses the Discord Game SDK (sadly something not open source), you have to get a copy of
(discord_game_sdk.dll, discord_game_sdk.dylib, discord_game_sdk.so) yourself.

You can get it at [This Link](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide).

Just drag the files from the lib/x86_64 folder into the addons/discord_game_sdk folder to make RPC work (it auto detects).
